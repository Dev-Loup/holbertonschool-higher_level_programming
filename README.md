# Python language: High level Programming

This repository is all focused in python language but some C functions are checked for implementation in python programming

## Badges

Projects are labeled using hexadecimal enumeration for getting into computer numeration systems, every exercise could be used in further projects so it's recomended to follow the projects in order

All the code is available but challenges are present in the README of every project, please try to solve before looking for the code

## Utils Installation

### Install PEP8
`Pycodestyle` is now the [new standard of Python style code](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle), but we will use `PEP8`, `version 1.7.*` Don’t worry, `pycodestyle` is based on `pep8`. The hardest part now is to install it for Python 3:
* install pip3
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
* install pep8
```shell
$ sudo pip3 install pep8
```
* Make sure you get pep8
```shell
$ pep8 --version
```
* If not try installing pycodestyle
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install pycodestyle
```
## Recomendations

### About C Coding

* Projects were checked with gcc 4.8.4 using -Werror -Wall -Wextra -pedantic even if it´s not necessary using the flags test your code is correctly written and there are no potencial mistakes
* Betty code style is the standard code style, you can get [the betty checker here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) and documentation about using it in different text editors
* All your files must end with a new line
### About Python scripting
* Projects are checked with `python3`
* All your files must end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Code style is checked using `pep8 1.7`
### General
* while working in your own repo remember to write a README.md, more information about [writting README's is here](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
* Using global variables is not allowed
